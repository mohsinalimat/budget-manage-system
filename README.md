# Budget Management System

## Overview
        A comprehensive budget management feature for ERPNext that provides monthly budget distribution and real-time budget tracking with configurable actions when limits are exceeded.

## Features

### 🎯 Budget
Advanced budget control system with monthly distribution and automatic enforcement.

### 📊 Monthly Budget Distribution
The system automatically distributes annual budgets across months with precise tracking:

**Example Implementation:**
- **Item:** Office Equipment Purchase
- **Annual Budget:** 12,000 EGP
- **Monthly Distribution:** 8.33% per month (1,000 EGP/month)

```
January: 8.33% (1,000 EGP)
February: 8.33% (1,000 EGP)
...
December: 8.33% (1,000 EGP)
```

---

## How It Works

### Smart Budget Tracking
ERPNext budget management goes beyond annual limits by providing monthly distribution for more precise control. When a month's budget is exhausted, the system can:

- ❌ **Stop** transactions completely
- ⚠️ **Warn** users while allowing transactions

Configuration options:
- `Action Action if Monthly Budget Exceeded on PO = Stop`
- `Action Action if Monthly Budget Exceeded on PO = Warn`

---

## Usage Examples

### ✅ Approved Transaction
**January Scenario:**
- Employee creates Purchase Order for 850 EGP
- **Result:** ✅ Approved (under 1,000 EGP monthly limit)

### ❌ Blocked/Warning Transaction
**January Scenario:**
- Employee attempts Purchase Order for 1,200 EGP  
- **Result:** ❌ Blocked or ⚠️ Warning shown (exceeds 8.33% monthly allocation)

### System Behavior
When attempting Purchase Orders exceeding the monthly limit (1,000 EGP in January), the system will:
- Block the transaction if set to "Stop"
- Show warning if set to "Warn"

---

## Configuration

### Budget Actions
Configure system behavior when monthly budgets are exceeded:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stop** | Completely prevent transactions exceeding monthly budget |
| **Warn** | Show warning but allow transaction to proceed |
